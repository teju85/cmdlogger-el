HOW TO USE THIS?
================

Include the following lines in your `.emacs` file:

    (require 'cmdlogger)
    (cmdlogger-mode t)

To disable this mode temporarily in your session:

    (cmdlogger-mode nil)
    ;; do you secret-stuff here!
    (cmdlogger-mode t)

Use `customize` to figure out variables that can be customized.
